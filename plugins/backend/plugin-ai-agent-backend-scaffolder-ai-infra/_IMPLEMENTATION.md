# Scaffolder AI Infra Implementation Plan

## Goal

Implement `@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-backend-scaffolder-ai-infra` as a **custom Scaffolder action** (plus a companion AI Core runner for persisted preview/replay) that generates security-hardened Infrastructure-as-Code inside the live Scaffolder workspace during a template run. It reads capacity/provider parameters from the action input, pulls the organization's approved base blueprint via `coreServices.urlReader`, deterministically routes to a **Terraform expert** or **CloudFormation expert** generator node, injects catalog-derived ownership tags, validates the emitted files against policy and syntax, self-corrects a bounded number of times on validation failure, and only then writes the files into the workspace. A paired frontend plugin renders generation previews, validation findings, and run history.

Reuse the architecture proven by `plugin-ai-agent-backend-catalog-ai-insights` (its `_IMPLEMENTATION.md` is the source of truth for repository conventions, workflow-runner mechanics, event contracts, monorepo wiring, and test-layer definitions). This plan documents only what differs: the **Scaffolder action boundary**, **role-routed generation**, the **self-correcting validation loop**, and **workspace write semantics**.

## Delivery Boundary

### In scope

- One infra-generation request per action invocation (or per `/agents/scaffolder-ai-infra/runs` call for preview), scoped to a single service and provider.
- Deterministic `intake → blueprint.load → route → generate → validate → correct → emit` graph. Routing, required-field checks, policy rejection, and the workspace write are pure code; the model fills bounded template holes only.
- Bounded reads: approved blueprints via `coreServices.urlReader` and `vcs.repository.read_file`; catalog ownership/duplication checks via the catalog adapter; policy verdicts via `compliance.policy.evaluate` / `compliance.architecture.validate`.
- A **self-correcting** validation edge: syntax/semantic failures are fed back to the generating expert node up to `maxCorrectionRounds`.
- Files written **only** into the action's `ctx.workspacePath`, after all validation passes.
- A structured, citation-required `InfraGenerationReport` artifact for preview/replay, plus streaming run events.
- A minimal frontend: preview page, generation dialog, live SSE run view, per-file preview, validation-findings panel, run history.

### Explicitly out of scope for v1

- **Provisioning or applying infrastructure.** No `terraform apply`, no cloud SDK writes, no `cloud.*` mutation. The action emits *files*; a later pipeline applies them.
- Opening pull requests or committing to a repository — the workspace write is the only file-system effect, and it stays inside the scaffolder task sandbox.
- Generating credentials, secrets, key material, or IAM trust policies granting broad privileges; these are hard-blocked, not merely discouraged.
- Authoring or mutating the corporate blueprints themselves; the agent only reads approved sources.
- Multi-provider or multi-service fan-out in one run; one provider + one service per invocation.
- Free-form IaC unconstrained by a blueprint — if no approved blueprint resolves for the requested provider, the run terminates `blueprint_unavailable` rather than improvising.

## Required Prerequisites

Contracts verified against the current codebase and the installed Backstage SDK. As with the catalog plan: no fictional service refs — the foundation doc's `ScaffolderService` sketch must not be implemented as written.

**Verified, and unusually favorable:** unlike the sibling `scaffolder-*` agents, this plugin's integration surface **already exists**. `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node@0.13.5` is an installed workspace dependency (already consumed by `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-vcs`) and exports `createTemplateAction`, `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint`, and an `ActionContext` type carrying `workspacePath`, `input`, `logger`, `checkpoint()`, `output()`, `getInitiatorCredentials()`, `task.id`, `templateInfo`, and `isDryRun`. A real Scaffolder action is viable in v1 — there is no blocking integration gate.

| Capability | Required contract | Current state | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scaffolder action registration | `createTemplateAction`, `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint` from `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` | **Exists** (v0.13.5 installed; `ActionContext` exposes `workspacePath`/`input`/`checkpoint`/`isDryRun`) | Register the action from a `pluginId: 'scaffolder'` backend module; add the dependency to this package's `package.json`. |
| Workspace file write | `ctx.workspacePath` + `fs-extra` | **Exists** | Resolve every output path against `workspacePath` and reject traversal. Honor `ctx.isDryRun` by reporting without writing. |
| Approved blueprint fetch | `coreServices.urlReader` | **Exists**, used across the VCS modules | Read hardened base modules from the config-declared allow-list only; cap bytes. |
| Blueprint from a repo | `vcs.repository.read_file` | Exists, `effect: read` | Alternative source when the blueprint lives in a Git repo rather than at a URL. |
| Generated-IaC policy check | `compliance.policy.evaluate` | **Exists**, `effect: read`; its registered description is literally "Evaluate generated IaC, config, or proposed actions against OPA/Rego or static policy bundles" | Primary guardrail on the *generated* files. `passed: false` blocks the workspace write. |
| Architecture constraints | `compliance.architecture.validate` | **Exists**, `effect: read` | Validate capacity/region/public-access shape before generation and re-validate the emitted files. |
| Ownership tags + duplicate check | Catalog access via a `catalogServiceRef` adapter | Pattern **exists** (`CatalogContextResolver` in catalog-ai-insights uses `getEntityByRef`) | Reuse that adapter shape to inject `tags = { Owner = ... }` and to detect a pre-existing `Resource` before generating. |
| Blueprint/pattern context | `knowledge.retrieve` + `DefaultRetrievalPipeline` | Exists | Optional; module-usage guidance only. Must never override blueprint text or a policy verdict. |
| Run persistence / preview / cost | AI Core runner, artifacts, checkpoints, token accounting | Exist | The companion runner gives the action persisted replayable runs and cost accounting (the foundation doc's "token accounting recorded" requirement). |
| **Action test harness** | `createMockActionContext` from `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node-test-utils` | **Not installed** — absent from `node_modules` and `yarn.lock` | Add it as a `devDependency`, or implement a local typed `createTestActionContext()` helper. **Blocking for the action test layer only.** |

## Package Shape

Backend module from the same template as `catalog-ai-insights`, with one structural difference: this package exports **two** backend modules — the AI Core agent module and a Scaffolder action module. Every directory carries a barrel `index.ts` re-exporting its public surface, matching the reference plugin's export styling.

```

- AI Core module: `createBackendModule` with `pluginId: 'ai-core'`, `moduleId: 'agent-scaffolder-ai-infra'`; deps `coreServices.rootConfig`, `coreServices.logger`, `coreServices.urlReader`, `coreServices.discovery`, `coreServices.auth`, `catalogServiceRef`, plus `agentExtensionPoint`, `triggerExtensionPoint`, `workflowRunnerExtensionPoint`.
- Scaffolder module: `createBackendModule` with `pluginId: 'scaffolder'`, `moduleId: 'ai-infra-action'`; deps `coreServices.rootConfig`, `coreServices.logger`, `coreServices.urlReader`, `coreServices.discovery`, `coreServices.auth`, plus `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint`. **No new core service keys are introduced.**
- `coreServices.scheduler` is intentionally **unused**: generation is strictly request/task-driven, so there is no background-task section in this plan.
- Package naming, scripts, Apache header, root `tsconfig.json` references, and `.eslintrc.cjs` role overrides follow `catalog-ai-insights` and `plugin-registration.md` verbatim (not repeated here).

## Monorepo And App Wiring

Same delegated-but-verified steps as `catalog-ai-insights` (see that plan's "Monorepo And App Wiring"). Deltas:

- **Two backend loads**: add `"@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-backend-scaffolder-ai-infra": "workspace:^"` to `packages/backend/package.json`, then add **both** features in `packages/backend/src/index.ts` — the `ai-core` agent module and the `scaffolder` action module. The action module must be added **after** `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` so the extension point exists.
- **Action availability**: the action only appears to templates once its module is loaded; a template referencing `ai:infra:generate` before that fails at task execution. Document the action ID and input schema in the package README.
- **Compliance module gate**: post-generation policy validation requires `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-compliance` plus a driver. With no driver configured, validation degrades to syntax-only and the report carries an explicit limitation — the write still proceeds only if syntax passes, and the limitation must be surfaced.
- **App config**: the module throws at boot without `ai.agents.scaffolderInfra.model` and at least one entry under `blueprints.sources`; add the config block (see Configuration) before enabling the loads.
- **Frontend registration**: add `"@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-scaffolder-ai-infra": "workspace:^"` to `packages/app/package.json`, import its `/alpha` default export in `packages/app/src/App.tsx`, and extend plugin-ID expectations in `packages/app/src/App.test.tsx`.
- **Yarn PnP refresh**: `yarn install` after any `package.json` edit, then `yarn typecheck --force` / `yarn lint --force`.

## Agent Definition

```ts
{
  id: 'scaffolder-ai-infra',
  modelRef: config.modelRef,          // installation-registered ID, e.g. 'scaffolder-infra'
  workflowRef: 'scaffolder-infra',
  memory: 'none',                     // each generation is a fresh blueprint + parameter set
  systemPrompt: SCAFFOLDER_INFRA_SYSTEM_PROMPT,   // base; role prompts layered per node
  toolIds: [
    'vcs.repository.read_file',
    'compliance.policy.evaluate',
    'compliance.architecture.validate',
    'knowledge.retrieve',
  ],
  triggers: [
    { id: 'infra-generate-on-demand', source: 'manual', agentId: 'scaffolder-ai-infra' },
  ],
}
```

- **Every registered tool is `effect: 'read'`.** There is no write tool: the only mutation is the workspace file write performed by the *action* under `ctx.workspacePath`, deliberately outside the tool/approval system because it is sandboxed to the scaffolder task and discarded if that task fails.
- Blueprint fetching uses `coreServices.urlReader` directly (not a tool) because it is an infrastructure read bound by the config allow-list, mirroring how the VCS modules consume it.
- Two **role system prompts** layer over the base prompt, selected by `route.ts`: `TERRAFORM_EXPERT_PROMPT` and `CLOUDFORMATION_EXPERT_PROMPT`. Each receives only its own dialect's blueprint and is instructed to emit that dialect exclusively.
- System prompt rules: fill **only** the marked holes in the supplied blueprint — never restructure it, never add resources it does not declare, never invent module sources or versions; emit no credentials, secrets, key material, or wildcard IAM; capacity/region/name values are supplied pre-validated and must be used verbatim; cite `bp-N`/`cat-N`/`kb-N` evidence IDs for every non-blueprint value; return only file contents in the requested dialect.

## Run Input Contract

The action input schema and the runner payload share one versioned shape. As an action it is `ai:infra:generate` input; as a run it is the JSON `AgentRunInput.input.query`.

```ts
type InfraGenerationRequest = {
  version: 1;
  source: 'action' | 'manual';
  provider: 'terraform' | 'cloudformation';   // required; drives role routing
  serviceName: string;                        // required; 'order-processor'
  entityRef?: string;                         // component ref for ownership tags
  environment?: string;                       // 'test' | 'staging' | 'prod'
  capacity?: {                                // validated against config maxima
    cpu?: number;
    memoryMb?: number;
    storageGb?: number;
    instanceType?: string;
  };
  region?: string;                            // checked against the allowed region set
  blueprintId?: string;                       // select a specific approved blueprint
  outputDir?: string;                         // workspace-relative; default '.'
};
```

Validation requires `provider` and `serviceName`, coerces `serviceName` to the platform naming convention, rejects capacity above `capacity.max*`, rejects a `region` outside `allowedRegions`, rejects unknown fields, and resolves `outputDir` against `ctx.workspacePath` with traversal (`..`, absolute paths, symlinks) refused before any generation begins.

## Generation Workflow

`InfraGraph` registers as `WorkflowRunner` id `scaffolder-infra`. It realizes the foundation doc's graph: **Parse Params → Router → (Terraform Node | CloudFormation Node) → Lint & Validation Node → Update Local Workspace**, with a self-correcting edge from validation back to the generating node. Routing, validation, and the write are deterministic; the model only fills blueprint holes.

### Deterministic graph nodes

1. **intake** — validate `InfraGenerationRequest`; `intake.ts` normalizes capacity units and the service name, then `CatalogInfraResolver` resolves the owning group for tags (`cat-N` evidence) and checks for a **pre-existing `Resource`** with the same identifier. A duplicate terminates as `duplicate_resource` before any model call, satisfying the foundation doc's "doesn't create duplicate cloud setups" requirement.
2. **preflight** — `compliance.architecture.validate` checks the *requested shape* (capacity, region, public-access flags) before spending tokens. A violation terminates as `policy_rejected` carrying the driver's constraint messages; nothing is generated.
3. **blueprint.load** — `BlueprintRegistry` resolves the approved source for `(provider, blueprintId)` from the config allow-list **only**, then reads it via `coreServices.urlReader` (or `vcs.repository.read_file` for repo-hosted blueprints), capped at `maxBlueprintBytes`. Unresolvable or empty → terminal `blueprint_unavailable`; the agent never improvises IaC from scratch.
4. **route** — `route.ts` (pure, no LLM) maps `provider` to the expert role and its prompt/dialect/validator triple. Routing is a lookup, not an inference, so the foundation doc's "assert the router directed state to the Terraform Expert node" is directly assertable.
5. **generate** — one model call under the selected role prompt, given the blueprint text, the pre-validated parameters, and the owner tags. `generate.ts` parses the response into `GeneratedFile[]` (path + content), rejecting any path outside `outputDir` and any file whose extension does not match the dialect.
6. **validate** — `validate.ts` runs three layers in order, collecting `Finding[]`: (a) **dialect syntax** — HCL block/brace/quote balance and required-argument closure for Terraform, YAML/JSON parse plus a required top-level `Resources` for CloudFormation; (b) **light semantics** — every blueprint-declared variable bound, no undeclared references, no `TODO`/placeholder residue; (c) **policy** — `compliance.policy.evaluate` over the generated file contents. Any finding with `blocking: true` prevents the write.
7. **correct** *(self-correcting edge)* — when findings exist and rounds remain, `correct.ts` (pure) compiles a bounded, minimal instruction set from the findings and loops back to **generate** with the prior output plus the attached errors. Capped at `maxCorrectionRounds`; exhausting it terminates as `validation_failed` with the residual findings. This is the foundation doc's "passes the error block backward to the generating expert node" requirement.
8. **emit** — emit the `infra-generation-report` artifact. In the runner (preview) path the graph stops here. In the **action** path, `workspaceWriter.ts` then writes the validated files under `ctx.workspacePath`, calls `ctx.output('files', ...)`, and reports without writing when `ctx.isDryRun` is true.

### State and output schema

```ts
type EvidenceRef = { id: string; source: 'blueprint' | 'catalog' | 'policy' | 'knowledge'; summary: string; reference?: string };

type GeneratedFile = {
  path: string;                   // workspace-relative, always inside outputDir
  content: string;                // redacted before it reaches SSE/artifacts
  dialect: 'hcl' | 'yaml' | 'json';
  bytes: number;
};

type Finding = {
  id: string;                     // 'find-1' ...
  layer: 'syntax' | 'semantic' | 'policy';
  path?: string;                  // offending file
  line?: number;
  rule: string;                   // validator rule or driver-reported rule
  message: string;                // verbatim from validator/driver
  blocking: boolean;              // true blocks the workspace write
};

// InfraGenerationState: { request, role, blueprint?, files: GeneratedFile[],
//   findings: Finding[], corrections: number, limitations: string[],
//   status: 'generated'|'written'|'validation_failed'|'policy_rejected'
//         |'blueprint_unavailable'|'duplicate_resource'|'partial' }

type InfraGenerationReport = {
  serviceName: string;
  provider: 'terraform' | 'cloudformation';
  role: 'terraform-expert' | 'cloudformation-expert';
  status: InfraGenerationState['status'];
  blueprintId?: string;
  blueprintSource?: string;       // resolved allow-listed URL, credentials stripped
  files: { path: string; bytes: number; dialect: string }[];  // metadata; content in preview only
  findings: Finding[];
  corrections: number;            // self-correction rounds consumed
  ownerTag?: string;              // injected 'team-checkout'
  limitations: string[];
  evidence: EvidenceRef[];        // bp-N + cat-N + policy (+ kb-N) bundle
};
```

Status mapping is fixed in code, not inferred: validated files written by the action → `written`; validated files from the preview runner → `generated`; residual blocking findings after the correction cap → `validation_failed`; preflight architecture violation → `policy_rejected`; no approved blueprint → `blueprint_unavailable`; existing catalog `Resource` → `duplicate_resource`. `partial` covers syntax-only validation (no compliance driver) and always carries a limitation.

## Role-Routed Generation (New Structural Section)

The foundation doc's "multi-agent network split by technology roles" is realized as one graph with role-scoped prompts and validators, not as separate agents — this keeps token accounting, tool caps, and event streaming unified.

- `route.ts` is a pure lookup returning a `RoleBinding`: `{ role, promptRef, dialect, validators, fileNamer }`. Adding a provider (e.g. Pulumi) means adding one binding plus a validator, with no graph surgery.
- Each role receives **only** its own dialect's blueprint. A Terraform request never sees CloudFormation text, which removes the most common cross-dialect contamination failure.
- `fileNamer` is deterministic per role (Terraform → `main.tf`/`variables.tf`; CloudFormation → `template.yaml`), so output paths are never model-chosen. This is what makes the foundation doc's "confirm a valid `main.tf` was written" assertion stable.
- The shared `InfraGenerationState` carries the blueprint, parameters, and findings across nodes, so a correction round re-enters the *same* role with full context — the foundation doc's "shared infrastructure state variables".
- Role prompts are versioned constants in `agent.ts` covered by prompt-snapshot tests, so an edit that would loosen the "fill only marked holes" constraint fails review.

## Self-Correcting Validation Loop (New Structural Section)

The foundation doc explicitly requires recovery from LLM syntax slips, and equally requires that the loop cannot spin.

- `validate.ts` is pure over already-fetched policy results: given file contents it returns `Finding[]` with no I/O beyond the injected policy verdict, making every rule unit-testable on fixture files.
- **Syntax before semantics before policy**, short-circuiting per layer: an unparseable file is not worth a policy call, which keeps a malformed generation cheap.
- `correct.ts` compiles findings into a *minimal* instruction set — offending path, line, and verbatim validator message only. It never restates the whole file and never invents a fix, so the correcting model call stays small and grounded.
- The loop is bounded by `maxCorrectionRounds` (default 2) and is **monotonic**: a round that fails to reduce the blocking-finding count aborts immediately rather than consuming the remaining budget. Exhaustion is a first-class `validation_failed` outcome, never a silent partial write.
- Every round is recorded on the state and surfaced as `corrections`, so operators can alert on a rising self-correction rate as a model-quality signal.

## Workspace Write Semantics (New Structural Section)

This is the plugin's only mutation, so its boundaries are stated precisely.

- **All-or-nothing**: files are generated and validated fully in memory, then written in one pass. A blocking finding means **zero** files are written — the workspace is never left half-populated.
- Every path is resolved with `path.resolve(ctx.workspacePath, outputDir, file.path)` and asserted to remain within `ctx.workspacePath`; `..` segments, absolute paths, and symlinked parents are refused. Overwriting an existing workspace file requires `allowOverwrite: true` in config.
- `ctx.isDryRun` is honored: the report is produced and `ctx.output()` populated, but nothing is written — so template authors can preview the action inside Scaffolder's dry-run.
- The write is intentionally **not** an AI Core write tool and needs no approval gate: it is confined to the scaffolder task sandbox and discarded if the task fails, and nothing here can reach a repository, cluster, or cloud account. Stated explicitly so the absence of an approval gate reads as a reasoned decision rather than an oversight.
- `ctx.checkpoint()` wraps the write so a retried task step does not duplicate work, and `ctx.output('files', ...)` publishes the manifest for downstream template steps (e.g. a later publish step).

## Vector Store Integration

- **No new vector infrastructure.** `knowledge.retrieve` is a secondary path supplying module-usage guidance (how the approved base module is normally wired) so generated files follow house patterns. Indexing/storage remain owned by `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-retrieval-augmenter` and the pgvector/qdrant modules; run state by `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-runtime-store`.
- Retrieval **must never** override blueprint text, a policy verdict, a validator finding, or a routing decision. Tests assert the emitted files and findings are byte-identical with retrieval enabled and disabled for a fixed blueprint and parameter set.

## Configuration

```yaml
ai:
  agents:
    scaffolderInfra:
      model: scaffolder-infra       # installation-registered model ID, required
      maxBlueprintBytes: 65536      # optional, default 65536 per blueprint
      maxGeneratedBytes: 131072     # optional, default 131072 total output
      maxFiles: 8                   # optional, default 8 generated files
      maxToolInvocations: 10        # optional, default 10
      maxCorrectionRounds: 2        # optional, default 2 self-correction cap
      allowOverwrite: false         # optional, default false
      blueprints:                   # REQUIRED, non-empty; the only allowed sources
        sources:
          - id: aws-rds-base
            provider: terraform
            url: https://github.com/acme/terraform-modules/blob/main/rds/main.tf
          - id: aws-ecs-base
            provider: cloudformation
            url: https://github.com/acme/cfn-templates/blob/main/ecs/template.yaml
      policies:                     # evaluated over the GENERATED files
        - id: iac-security
        - id: iac-tagging
      capacity:                     # deterministic preflight maxima
        maxCpu: 8
        maxMemoryMb: 16384
        maxStorageGb: 512
      allowedRegions: ['us-east-1', 'us-west-2', 'eu-west-1']
      forbidPublicIngress: true     # optional, default true
```

`config.ts` mirrors `readCatalogAiInsightsConfig`: throw when the section, `model`, or a non-empty `blueprints.sources` is absent; document every default in `config.d.ts`. Validate at boot that each source declares a known `provider` and that its `url` is readable by the configured `urlReader` integrations — an unreachable or provider-less blueprint is a startup error, not a runtime surprise.

## Shared AI-Core Work To Build First

- **Action test harness (blocking for the action test layer only)** — either add `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node-test-utils` as a `devDependency` or implement a local typed `createTestActionContext()` returning the verified `ActionContext` shape (`workspacePath`, `input`, `logger`, `checkpoint`, `output`, `getInitiatorCredentials`, `task.id`, `isDryRun`). Nothing in the repo provides this today.
- **Catalog adapter reuse** — `CatalogInfraResolver` should follow the existing `CatalogContextResolver` (`getEntityByRef`) shape rather than inventing a new abstraction; promote it to `plugin-ai-core-node/src/catalog/` if the shared `CatalogEntityResolver` lands first.
- **No Scaffolder core helper is required for v1** — unlike the sibling `scaffolder-*` agents, this plugin consumes the real, installed `createTemplateAction`/`scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint` contract directly. Do **not** build a bespoke pre-flight abstraction here.
- **No new generation, validation, or persistence machinery in core** — `route.ts`/`validate.ts`/`correct.ts` are plugin-local pure modules; runner registration, artifacts, checkpoints, and token accounting all exist and are exercised as-is.

## Frontend Plan

Mirror the `catalog-ai-insights` frontend layout and wiring exactly: `alpha.ts` composing extensions into a `createFrontendPlugin` `FrontendFeature`, `extensions/api.ts` using `ApiBlueprint.make({ params: defineParams => defineParams(createApiFactory({...})) })`, `extensions/components.ts` using `PageBlueprint.make({ name, params: { path, title, routeRef, loader } })` with lazy `import(...)` loaders, self-contained wire types in `@types/`, and an SSE client over `discoveryApi.getBaseUrl('ai-core')` with `eventsource-parser` and `Last-Event-ID` replay. Every directory carries a barrel `index.ts`.

Frontend deltas vs `catalog-ai-insights`:

- `backstage.pluginId: 'scaffolder-ai-infra'`; package `@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-scaffolder-ai-infra`.
- Primary surface is a **standalone preview page** (nav item) via `PageBlueprint`. No `EntityCardBlueprint` — the subject is a template run, not a catalog entity.
- **Preview only.** `previewGeneration()` POSTs `/agents/scaffolder-ai-infra/runs`, which is the runner path and therefore **never writes to a workspace**; the write happens exclusively inside a real Scaffolder task. The UI must label this clearly so a preview is not mistaken for provisioning.
- `CorrectionTimeline` is the distinguishing surface: it makes the self-correction loop visible (round → findings fixed → residual), the main debugging aid when a model repeatedly fails validation.
- `FindingsPanel` separates `blocking` from advisory findings, because only the former explain why files were not written.
- `blueprint_unavailable`, `duplicate_resource`, and `policy_rejected` render as first-class explained outcomes (not errors), each naming the blueprint/resource/constraint involved; `limitations` and the syntax-only degradation are always visible.

## Test Strategy

Reuse the `catalog-ai-insights` test-layer table (unit/contract/backend integration/runtime integration/LLM evaluation/full-stack E2E) and its network policies. Deltas only:

- **Unit (the highest-value layer here)**: `route.ts` provider → role mapping including unknown-provider rejection. `validate.ts` per-layer rules on fixture files — unbalanced HCL braces, an unclosed required argument (the foundation doc's explicit case), CloudFormation missing `Resources`, unbound blueprint variable, `TODO` residue. `correct.ts` minimal-instruction compilation and the monotonic abort. `intake.ts` capacity/region/name coercion and rejection. `workspaceWriter.ts` path-traversal refusal (`..`, absolute, symlink) and `allowOverwrite` behavior.
- **Action tests** (the foundation doc's primary scenario): with `createMockActionContext` (or the local helper) build a context with `input: { provider: 'terraform', serviceName: 'order-processor', capacityCpu: 4 }` and `workspacePath: '/tmp/scaffolder-scratchpad'`; stub `urlReader` to return `variable "capacity" { type = number }`. Assert the router selected the **Terraform** role, the blueprint was read from the allow-listed source, a **valid `main.tf` exists at the workspace path**, `ctx.output('files', ...)` was populated, and token/cost accounting was recorded on the run.
- **Self-correction tests** (foundation doc §2): script the model to emit a file missing a required parameter closure on round 1 and a valid file on round 2; assert validation detected it, `correct.ts` fed the error back to the *same* role, `corrections === 1`, and the final workspace file is valid. Then script a persistently invalid model and assert `validation_failed`, `corrections === maxCorrectionRounds`, and **zero files written**.
- **Provider-parity tests**: the same request with `provider: 'cloudformation'` routes to the CloudFormation role, reads the CFN blueprint, and writes `template.yaml`; assert no HCL appears in that output and no YAML in the Terraform output.
- **Guardrail tests**: capacity above `maxCpu` and a region outside `allowedRegions` both terminate at **preflight** with `policy_rejected` and no model call; a generated file containing a credential-shaped literal or wildcard IAM is a `blocking` policy finding that blocks the write.
- **Dry-run test**: `ctx.isDryRun: true` produces a full report and populated `ctx.output()` but leaves the workspace directory empty.
- **Duplicate-resource test**: catalog returns an existing `Resource` for the service identifier → `duplicate_resource` before any model call.
- **Workflow (runtime) tests**: drive `InfraGraph.run()` with a stubbed `WorkflowContext` whose `invokeTool` is a **dynamic mock router keyed by `toolId` + args** — the codebase-accurate replacement for the foundation doc's `createServiceFactory` sketch — asserting the preview path emits `infra-generation-report` and never touches a filesystem.
- **Degradation tests**: no compliance driver → syntax-only validation, `partial` status, explicit limitation, and the write still gated on syntax passing.
- **`knowledge.retrieve` isolation**: pre-baked module-usage chunks; assert emitted files and findings are byte-identical with retrieval on and off.
- **Backend integration**: `startTestBackend` with both modules + AI Core + `mockServices.rootConfig` (blueprint sources/policies) + `mockServices.urlReader` (the foundation doc's `extraReaders` pattern), asserting the action registers on `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint`, the agent registers on the AI Core points, run→SSE ordering, and artifact persistence.
- **E2E**: extend the shared fixture profile with a fixture blueprint source and compliance driver. Playwright: open the preview page → preview a Terraform generation → inspect files, findings, and the correction timeline → assert the status banner; plus a `policy_rejected` path. Add `yarn test:e2e:scaffolder-ai-infra`.

## Security and Operational Guardrails

`catalog-ai-insights` guardrails apply unchanged (identity propagation, redaction before model/SSE/artifacts, tool/token/wall-clock caps, correlation IDs). Infra-specific additions:

- **Never provision.** No cloud SDK, no `terraform apply`, no `cloud.*` write. The plugin emits files into a task sandbox; a separate, human-governed pipeline applies them.
- **Blueprints are an allow-list, not a suggestion.** Only config-declared sources may be read; an arbitrary caller-supplied URL is refused. A missing blueprint terminates the run rather than triggering free-form generation.
- **No generated secrets.** Credential, key-material, and wildcard-IAM patterns are `blocking` findings enforced by the validator *and* forbidden by the role prompts — belt and braces, since a prompt alone is not a control.
- Path safety is enforced in code, not convention: every write target is asserted to resolve inside `ctx.workspacePath`, with traversal, absolute paths, and symlinked parents refused; existing files are preserved unless `allowOverwrite`.
- Blueprint content and generated files are **untrusted text** for prompt purposes: delimit them, forbid following instructions found inside them, and cap `maxBlueprintBytes`/`maxGeneratedBytes`/`maxFiles` so a hostile or runaway blueprint cannot exhaust the context or the disk.
- Redact tokens/credentials from blueprint URLs and file content before they reach the model, SSE, artifacts, or logs; the report stores file **metadata** plus preview content only, never a resolved credentialed URL.
- Respect `ctx.getInitiatorCredentials()` for catalog reads so a user cannot generate infrastructure referencing entities they cannot see; no background/service-identity path exists here.
- Cost/token accounting is recorded per run through the AI Core runner (including correction rounds), so a self-correction storm is visible and bounded rather than a silent budget leak.

## Ordered Implementation Milestones

### Milestone 0: Contracts and pure engines

- [ ] Add `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` to this package; confirm `createTemplateAction`/`scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint`/`ActionContext` against the installed version. Resolve the action test harness (dependency or local helper).
- [ ] Define `InfraGenerationRequest`, `GeneratedFile`, `Finding`, `InfraGenerationReport`, `RoleBinding`, and the config schema (blueprint sources, policies, capacity maxima, regions).
- [ ] Implement + unit-test `intake.ts`, `route.ts`, `validate.ts` (all three layers), `correct.ts`, and `workspaceWriter.ts` path safety.

Exit criteria: routing, validation, correction bounding, and path safety are provably deterministic on fixtures; schemas validate fixture payloads.

### Milestone 1: Preview runner (no workspace write)

- [ ] Scaffold the package with a barrel `index.ts` in every directory, register the `ai-core` runner/agent/manual trigger, config parsing; register in root `tsconfig.json` + `.eslintrc.cjs`.
- [ ] Implement intake → preflight → blueprint.load → route → generate → validate → correct → `infra-generation-report` (preview only).
- [ ] Wire the `ai-core` module into `packages/backend` and add the `ai.agents.scaffolderInfra` config block.
- [ ] Add unit, workflow-scenario (mock router), and backend integration tests including the degradation matrix.

Exit criteria: both provider roles generate validated files deterministically with no real LLM, no compliance provider, and no filesystem writes.

### Milestone 2: Scaffolder action and workspace write

- [ ] Implement `generateInfra.ts` via `createTemplateAction('ai:infra:generate')` with a typed input schema, plus `workspaceWriter.ts` all-or-nothing writes, `ctx.checkpoint()` wrapping, `ctx.output('files', ...)`, and `isDryRun` handling.
- [ ] Register `scaffolderModule.ts` on `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint` and load it in `packages/backend` after `plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
- [ ] Action tests (the foundation doc's Terraform scenario), self-correction tests, plus dry-run, path-traversal, overwrite, and duplicate-resource tests.

Exit criteria: a real action invocation writes a valid `main.tf` into the workspace, and every failure mode provably writes nothing.

### Milestone 3: Frontend and E2E

- [ ] Implement the frontend (`ApiBlueprint` + `PageBlueprint`, preview page, generation dialog, SSE run view, file list, findings panel, correction timeline, status banner) with barrel indexes, and register it in `packages/app`.
- [ ] Component tests (loading, streaming, written/generated/validation_failed/policy_rejected/blueprint_unavailable/duplicate_resource, replay) plus accessibility checks.
- [ ] Extend the E2E fixture profile and add Playwright preview and rejection scenarios with screenshot review.

Exit criteria: `yarn test:e2e:scaffolder-ai-infra` demonstrates a full preview with findings and correction timeline, plus a rejection path, in a browser without external infrastructure.

### Milestone 4: Production readiness

- [ ] Document model registration, blueprint-source curation, compliance driver configuration, the action ID/input schema for template authors, and the preview-vs-action distinction.
- [ ] Dashboards/alerts for generation volume by status, validation-failure rate, **self-correction rate**, policy-rejection rate, and token/cost per generation.
- [ ] Opt-in real-model evaluation suite (grounding: generated files parse in their dialect, contain no invented resources or module sources, bind every blueprint variable, and carry the catalog owner tag) within budget.

Exit criteria: staged rollout with a small curated blueprint set, bounded costs, and verified generation grounding.

## Definition of Done

- Both backend modules (`ai-core` agent/runner and `scaffolder` action), config schema, read-only tool allow-list, and the typed action input implemented and registered (root + backend wiring included), with a barrel `index.ts` in every directory.
- Runs execute through the real AI Core controller/runtime with persisted replayable events, token/cost accounting across correction rounds, and `infra-generation-report` artifacts.
- Provider routing, all three validation layers, correction bounding, and the workspace write are pure deterministic code — never model output — and the model only fills marked blueprint holes.
- The self-correction loop provably recovers a missing-closure generation within `maxCorrectionRounds` and provably terminates as `validation_failed` with **zero files written** when it cannot.
- The action writes only inside `ctx.workspacePath`, all-or-nothing, honoring `isDryRun` and refusing traversal/overwrite; nothing in the plugin can provision infrastructure, open a PR, or emit a credential.
- Frontend renders files, findings, and the correction timeline over live SSE and replay via `ApiBlueprint`/`PageBlueprint`, and labels preview as non-writing; Playwright verifies preview and rejection paths on fixtures.
- No output surface (SSE, artifacts, logs, tests) contains secrets, credentialed blueprint URLs, uncited values, or IaC generated outside an approved blueprint.

## Frontend Completed

Implemented the contract-matched preview frontend at:

`/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/plugins/frontend/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-scaffolder-ai-infra`

### Implemented surface

- Package `@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-scaffolder-ai-infra` with
  legacy and `./alpha` entrypoints; standalone `/scaffolder-ai-infra` page with
  `?run=<id>` replay.
- Typed preview/replay client for `scaffolder-ai-infra` AI Core runs.
- `useInfraRun` reducer/hook, provider/service/region preview dialog, status
  banner, generated-file metadata manifest, validation findings, correction
  count, limitations, and retained evidence.
- The preview page explicitly states that it is non-writing and cannot provision
  infrastructure or write a Scaffolder workspace.

### Contract limitation (not fabricated)

The implemented preview runner emits only `infra-generation-report` metadata.
No generated file contents and no report-list endpoint are persisted, so this
frontend intentionally does not invent syntax-highlighted content tabs or a
history/list API. File writes remain exclusive to the real
`ai:infra:generate` Scaffolder action.

### Wiring and validation

- Registered TypeScript/ESLint coverage, app package dependency, alpha feature,
  and app feature expectation.
- 5 focused tests cover report replay, progress/malformed artifact handling,
  blocking/empty validation findings, and explicit non-writing preview status.
- `yarn vitest run plugins/frontend/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-scaffolder-ai-infra/src` — __5 tests passed__
- Package `tsc --noEmit`, package lint, and app registration test — clean.

## Backend Completed

Implemented the deterministic approved-blueprint backend at:

`/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/plugins/backend/plugin-ai-agent-backend-scaffolder-ai-infra`

### Implemented

- Two real backend modules:
  - AI Core `scaffolder-ai-infra` preview runner (`scaffolder-infra` workflow)
  - Scaffolder `ai:infra:generate` action module registered through the verified
    `scaffolderActionsExtensionPoint`
- Shared versioned request schema, capacity/region/service-name validation,
  config-declared approved blueprint source selection, deterministic provider
  route (`main.tf` for Terraform; `template.yaml` for CloudFormation), and
  placeholder-only rendering.
- Deterministic validation blocks unresolved holes, secret material, public
  ingress, and wildcard IAM before any workspace write.
- Sandboxed workspace writer: resolved path containment, traversal rejection,
  all-or-nothing validation-before-write, dry-run manifest output, overwrite
  refusal by default, and the installed Scaffolder SDK's actual
  `ctx.checkpoint({ key, fn })` contract.
- Persisted non-writing preview reports as `infra-generation-report` artifacts.

### Contract limitations (not fabricated)

This delivery uses deterministic approved-blueprint hole rendering; it does not
fabricate a model generation/correction loop. Catalog ownership/duplicate
adapters, policy-driver validation over generated files, repository-blueprint
reads, RAG, and a dedicated Scaffolder action test helper require additional
confirmed integrations and remain deferred. The preview runner never writes a
workspace; writes occur only within an actual sandboxed Scaffolder action.

### Tests and validation

- 7 focused tests across 3 files: Terraform route/file name, deterministic
  placeholder render, blocking holes/secrets, workspace write, dry-run,
  traversal rejection, preview artifact, and blueprint-unavailable outcome.
- `yarn vitest run plugins/backend/plugin-ai-agent-backend-scaffolder-ai-infra/src` — __7 tests passed__
- Package `tsc --noEmit` and package lint — clean

### Wiring added

- `/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/tsconfig.json`
- `/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/.eslintrc.cjs`
- `/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/packages/backend/package.json`
- `/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/packages/backend/src/index.ts`
- `/home/kevin/Repos/backstage/ai-crew-suite/app-config.yaml`
