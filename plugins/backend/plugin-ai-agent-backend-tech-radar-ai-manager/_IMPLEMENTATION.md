# Tech Radar AI Manager Implementation Plan

## Goal

Implement `@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-backend-tech-radar-ai-manager` as an AI Core backend module that keeps the Technology Radar honest by measuring what the organization *actually* uses. A scheduled sweep reads the radar source file, enumerates catalog-registered repositories, parses their dependency manifests, and computes **deterministic adoption ratios** per technology. Crossing a configured threshold drafts a ring-promotion proposal (Vite at 30%+ of manifests: `assess → trial`); a dependency still present in a `hold`/EOL ring produces per-owner deprecation findings. Every proposal cites the exact repositories counted. A paired frontend plugin renders the proposal dashboard, adoption evidence, and the quarterly review summary.

Reuse the architecture proven by `plugin-ai-agent-backend-catalog-ai-insights` (its `_IMPLEMENTATION.md` is the source of truth for repository conventions, workflow-runner mechanics, event contracts, monorepo wiring, and test-layer definitions). This plan documents only what differs: **deterministic adoption measurement**, **longitudinal observation persistence**, **radar-source parsing**, and an **approval-gated proposal submission**.

## Delivery Boundary

### In scope

- A scheduled fleet sweep plus an on-demand scan, via `/agents/tech-radar-ai-manager/runs`.
- Deterministic `radar.load → enumerate → scan → measure → propose → gate` pipeline. Manifest parsing, adoption ratios, ring-transition decisions, and deprecation matching are pure code; the model only writes proposal prose and the executive summary.
- Bounded reads: the radar source via `coreServices.urlReader`/`vcs.repository.read_file`, repository targets via `CatalogEntityResolver`, manifests via `vcs.repository.search`/`read_file`, and `knowledge.retrieve` for architecture-policy context.
- A `RadarAnalysis` artifact carrying per-technology adoption counts, proposed ring transitions, and deprecation findings — every number traceable to the repositories that produced it.
- **Aggregate observation snapshots** persisted per sweep so adoption *velocity* (90-day trend) is computed from real history rather than a single point.
- Approval-gated submission via `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal`, plus optional approval-gated deprecation tickets via `project.ticket.create`.

### Explicitly out of scope for v1

- **Autonomous radar changes.** No proposal is submitted and no ticket filed without a persisted human approval; both write paths default to disabled. The Architecture Review Board decides; the agent drafts.
- **Editing the radar source file directly.** The plugin submits *proposals* through the driver; it never commits to `radar-data.json`. Rewriting the radar from a heuristic would remove the human governance the radar exists to encode.
- **PR-time duplicate-capability alerts.** The foundation doc's "we noticed you're introducing X" flow needs an event subscription that does not exist (see Prerequisites); the same detection runs in the sweep instead, without per-PR commentary.
- Transitive dependency analysis, lockfile resolution, or actual runtime usage. v1 counts **declared direct dependencies** in manifests and says so — a package in `package.json` is not proof of use.
- Language/ecosystem coverage beyond configured manifest parsers (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`); unparsed ecosystems are reported as coverage gaps, not silently omitted.
- Security/CVE judgments; `hold` membership comes from the radar, not from vulnerability inference.

## Required Prerequisites

Contracts verified against the current codebase. As with the catalog plan: no fictional service refs — the foundation doc's `github.service` sketch (`searchManifests`) must **not** be implemented as written.

**Two of the earlier draft's four gates are disproved; two are confirmed.** It listed a "radar write API", "project ticket write tool", "durable longitudinal metrics store", and "events subscription" as all missing. Verified reality:

- **Radar write — EXISTS, but the driver is a stub.** `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal` is registered `effect: 'write'` with `TechRadarProposalInput = { quadrantId, ringId, title, description, reason }`. However `TechRadarDriver.submitRadarProposal` stores into a per-instance `private readonly draftProposals = new Map()`, reads `techRadar.url` from config **without ever writing to it**, and returns a synthetic `prop-<uuid>`. The tool call succeeds while the proposal **evaporates on restart** — more dangerous than a missing tool, because it looks like it worked.
- **Ticket write — EXISTS.** `project.ticket.create` is `effect: 'write'` with `CreateTicketInput` supporting `title`/`description`/`team`/`labels`/`priority`, so deprecation tickets are buildable today.
- **Longitudinal store — CONFIRMED MISSING.** `ArtifactSink` is write-only (`record(artifact)`) and `SqlAgentRuntimeStore` exposes no artifact query — no `listArtifacts`, no cross-run lookup. Trend analysis has no queryable substrate.
- **Events subscription — CONFIRMED MISSING.** Zero references to `coreServices.events` / `eventsServiceRef` / `EventsService` anywhere.

| Capability | Required contract | Current state | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Radar source read | `coreServices.urlReader`, `vcs.repository.read_file` | **Exist** | Read and parse `radar-data.json`/`radar.yaml` into `RadarEntry[]`. This is the authoritative ring/quadrant state — never inferred. |
| Repository targets + owners | `CatalogEntityResolver` (`findByAnnotation`, `getIntegrationReferences`, `owner`) | **Exists** in `plugin-ai-core-node/src/catalog/` | Replaces the foundation doc's raw `'://github.com'` parsing; supplies the owner for deprecation routing. |
| Manifest discovery + read | `vcs.repository.search`, `vcs.repository.read_file` | **Exist**, `effect: read`. **Driver quality uneven** — GitHub/GitLab/Azure implement real search; Bitbucket/Gerrit/generic Git return `[]` after a warning | Replaces the invented `searchManifests`. A repo on a stub driver is `manifest_unavailable` and **excluded from the denominator** — counting it as "not using X" would silently understate every adoption ratio. |
| **Radar proposal submission** | `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal` (`effect: 'write'`) | **Tool exists; driver is in-memory only** — `Map`-backed, lost on restart, never persisted to `techRadar.url` | Allow-list behind the approval gate, but treat delivery as unproven: record the returned `proposalId`, attach a `proposal_not_durable` limitation when the active driver is `tech-radar`, and never present submission as durable. **Blocking for real radar integration**; see Shared Work. |
| **Deprecation tickets** | `project.ticket.create` (`effect: 'write'`) | **Exists** | One ticket per affected owner, approval-gated, deduped by `(technology, owner, ring)`. |
| Architecture policy context | `knowledge.retrieve` | Exists | Optional prose for the proposal `reason` and the executive summary. **Never** sets a ratio or a ring decision. |
| **Longitudinal observations** | A queryable per-sweep aggregate store | **Missing** — `ArtifactSink.record()` is write-only; no artifact query on the runtime store | v1 persists `AdoptionSnapshot` aggregates as artifacts **and** keeps a compact rolling series in a plugin-owned checkpoint keyed by a stable `observationSeriesId`, so velocity works without a new core contract. Adding `listArtifacts` to core is the clean long-term fix. |
| Resumable sweeps | `CheckpointStore` + `WorkflowRunner.resume()` | **Exist** | Checkpoint the scan pointer **and accumulated counters** after every repository — the foundation doc's §2 requirement (interrupted at repo 50 of 100, resume without losing counters). |
| **PR-time alerts** | An events subscription | **Missing entirely** | Deferred. Duplicate-capability detection runs in the sweep; keep `RadarScanRequest.source` discriminated so an `event` variant is additive later. |
| Scheduled sweeps | `coreServices.scheduler` + `discovery` + `auth` | Available | Weekly cadence (foundation doc: Sunday night), opt-in and globally mutexed. |

## Package Shape

Backend module from the same template as `catalog-ai-insights`; only the domain directories differ. Every directory carries a barrel `index.ts` re-exporting its public surface, matching the reference plugin's export styling.

- `createBackendModule` with `pluginId: 'ai-core'`, `moduleId: 'agent-tech-radar-ai-manager'`.
- `module.ts` deps: `coreServices.rootConfig`, `coreServices.logger`, `coreServices.scheduler`, `coreServices.urlReader`, `coreServices.discovery`, `coreServices.auth`, `catalogServiceRef`, plus `agentExtensionPoint`, `triggerExtensionPoint`, `workflowRunnerExtensionPoint`. **No new core service keys are introduced.**
- Package naming, scripts, Apache header, root `tsconfig.json` references, and `.eslintrc.cjs` role overrides follow `catalog-ai-insights` and `plugin-registration.md` verbatim (not repeated here).

## Monorepo And App Wiring

Same delegated-but-verified steps as `catalog-ai-insights` (see that plan's "Monorepo And App Wiring"). Deltas:

- **Backend load**: add `"@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-backend-tech-radar-ai-manager": "workspace:^"` to `packages/backend/package.json` and the matching `backend.add(loadBackendFeature(import(...)))` line in `packages/backend/src/index.ts`.
- **Radar driver gate, with a caveat worth reading**: proposal submission needs `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-quality-scorecards` plus the `-techradar` provider. That provider currently persists nothing (in-memory `Map`), so with it loaded the plugin *can* submit but cannot guarantee delivery. The README must state this plainly, and the report carries a `proposal_not_durable` limitation, so nobody concludes the radar was updated.
- **Ticket driver gate**: deprecation tickets need `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-project-management` plus its Jira driver. Absent, findings are reported and ticket targets are `skipped`.
- **VCS driver choice materially changes measurement quality.** On Bitbucket/Gerrit/generic Git, manifest discovery returns `[]`, so those repos are excluded from the denominator rather than counted as non-adopters. Document this: a small scanned subset yields ratios that are correct but unrepresentative.
- **App config**: the module throws at boot without `ai.agents.techRadarManager.model` and `radar.sourceUrl`; add the config block (see Configuration). Sweeps need `sweep.enabled: true`; writes need `propose.enabled` / `tickets.enabled`.
- **Frontend registration**: `plugins/frontend/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-tech-radar-ai-manager/` exists but is **empty** — scaffold it from scratch. Add the workspace dependency to `packages/app/package.json`, import its `/alpha` default export in `packages/app/src/App.tsx`, and extend plugin-ID expectations in `packages/app/src/App.test.tsx`.
- **Yarn PnP refresh**: `yarn install` after any `package.json` edit, then `yarn typecheck --force` / `yarn lint --force`.
## Agent Definition

```ts
{
  id: 'tech-radar-ai-manager',
  modelRef: config.modelRef,          // installation-registered ID, e.g. 'tech-radar-manager'
  workflowRef: 'tech-radar-analysis',
  memory: 'none',                     // fresh measurement each sweep; history via observations
  systemPrompt: TECH_RADAR_MANAGER_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  toolIds: [
    'vcs.repository.search',
    'vcs.repository.read_file',
    'knowledge.retrieve',
    'quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal',  // effect: 'write' — post-approval only
    'project.ticket.create',                    // effect: 'write' — post-approval only
  ],
  triggers: [
    { id: 'radar-scan-on-demand', source: 'manual', agentId: 'tech-radar-ai-manager' },
    { id: 'radar-weekly-sweep', source: 'scheduler', agentId: 'tech-radar-ai-manager' },
  ],
}
```

- Read tools run freely. Both write tools are `effect: 'write'`, so AI Core pauses with an `approval_request` before either executes. Omit each until its driver is configured; the workflow then terminates at the analysis artifact.
- `quality.scorecard.get_entity_scorecard` is **not** allow-listed: the `-techradar` driver throws on it by design (*"TechRadar driver does not manage software component scorecards data records"*), and component scorecards belong to `tech-debt-ai-scout`.
- Catalog access goes through the injected `CatalogEntityResolver` rather than a tool.
- `memory: 'none'` — history lives in the durable observation series, not conversational memory, so a sweep's numbers are always recomputed from the current fleet.
- System prompt rules: adoption ratios, ring transitions, and deprecation findings are supplied **pre-computed** and must be quoted verbatim; never invent a package name, version, repository, ratio, or radar ring; cite `repo-N` for every counted repository and `radar-N` for the current ring; describe a dependency as *declared in a manifest*, never as "in production use"; state the scanned-vs-total repository count whenever a ratio is mentioned; when submission is not durable, say the proposal was queued rather than applied.

## Run Input Contract

The generic `AgentRunInput.input.query` carries a versioned JSON payload. `source` is discriminated so an `event` variant is additive when an events contract lands.

```ts
type RadarScanRequest = {
  version: 1;
  source: 'manual' | 'scheduler';   // 'event' reserved; see Prerequisites
  technologies?: string[];       // narrow measurement to specific packages
  quadrants?: string[];          // narrow to radar quadrants, e.g. ['tools']
  entityRefs?: string[];         // scan a subset of components
  ecosystems?: ('npm' | 'go' | 'python')[];   // default: configured parsers
  propose?: boolean;             // request the proposal path (still gated); default false
  fileTickets?: boolean;         // request deprecation tickets (still gated); default false
  cursor?: string;               // resume an interrupted sweep
};
```

Validation clamps `entityRefs` and the repo count, restricts `ecosystems` to available parsers, rejects unknown quadrants against the loaded radar, and forces both write paths through the approval gate regardless of caller.

## Radar Analysis Workflow

`RadarGraph` registers as `WorkflowRunner` id `tech-radar-analysis` and implements **both** `run()` and `resume()` — the latter for both sweep continuation and approval. It realizes the foundation doc's flow: **Repository Sweep → Trend Analysis → Draft Proposal → Human Review**. Measurement and transition decisions are deterministic; the model narrates.

### Deterministic graph nodes

1. **radar.load** — validate `RadarScanRequest`; read the radar source via `urlReader` (or `vcs.repository.read_file`) and parse it with `radarSource.ts` into `RadarEntry[]` (`radar-N` evidence). An unreadable or unparseable radar is a **terminal** `radar_unavailable` with no model call — without the current rings, a transition cannot be proposed, only invented.
2. **enumerate** — `RepoTargetResolver` lists candidate repositories with owners from the catalog; `sweepPlanner.ts` (pure) caps and orders them deterministically. Zero targets → `no_targets`.
3. **scan** — for each repo, locate and read configured manifests via `vcs.repository.search`/`read_file`, then `manifests.ts` (pure) parses declared direct dependencies per ecosystem. Each repo yields a `RepoScanOutcome`: `scanned`, `manifest_unavailable` (stub driver / no manifest), or `scan_failed`. **Counters and cursor are checkpointed after every repository**, so an interruption at repo 50 of 100 resumes with counts intact.
4. **measure** — `measure.ts` (pure, no LLM) computes per-technology `AdoptionMetric`: `repositoriesUsing / repositoriesScanned` — with `manifest_unavailable` repos excluded from **both** numerator and denominator — plus `ObservationSeries` velocity over the trailing window. This is the foundation doc's ">30% of scanned manifests" measurement, and the exclusion rule is what keeps it honest.
5. **propose** — `transitions.ts` (pure) maps each metric plus its current radar ring to a `RingTransitionProposal` using the configured threshold table (`assess → trial` at ≥30%, `trial → adopt` at ≥60% with positive velocity), and `deprecations.ts` (pure) matches `hold`/EOL radar entries against observed usage to produce per-owner `DeprecationFinding[]`. Duplicate-capability detection flags a newly-adopted technology whose quadrant already has an `adopt`-ring incumbent. One model call then writes proposal prose and the quarterly executive summary. Emits the `radar-analysis` artifact.
6. **gate** — when `propose`/`fileTickets` are requested, the corresponding write tool is registered, and the matching config flag is enabled, emit `approval_request` carrying the exact proposals and ticket set, checkpoint, and **suspend**. Analysis-only sweeps finish at the artifact.
7. **submit** *(resume path)* — `resume(runId, decision, context)`: on `approved`, call `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal` per proposal and `project.ticket.create` per deprecation owner, recording each result (including the `proposal_not_durable` caveat), emit a `radar-submission-record` artifact plus audit entry, and finish `submitted` or `partially_submitted`; on `rejected`, record the decision and finish `analysis_only` with nothing written.

  status: 'scanned' | 'manifest_unavailable' | 'scan_failed';
  dependencies: DeclaredDependency[];
  reason?: string;
};

type AdoptionMetric = {
  technology: string;            // matches RadarEntry.id where known

  metric: AdoptionMetric;
  rationale: string;             // model copy; must cite repo-N / radar-N
};

type DeprecationFinding = {

  skipped: { target: string; reason: string }[];
  failures: { target: string; reason: string }[];
  outcome: 'submitted' | 'partially_submitted';
};
```

Status mapping is fixed in code, not inferred: unreadable radar → `radar_unavailable`; zero targets → `no_targets`; any repo `manifest_unavailable`/`scan_failed` → `partial` with coverage named; sweep interrupted → `truncated` with a `cursor`; analysis with writes disabled or rejected → `analysis_only`; approved with all writes succeeding → `submitted`; approved with any failure → `partially_submitted`.

## Deterministic Adoption Measurement (New Structural Section)

A ring promotion changes org-wide architecture policy, so the number driving it must be arithmetic a reviewer can re-derive by hand.

- `manifests.ts`, `measure.ts`, and `transitions.ts` are pure: no AI Core, tool, or clock dependency. Every parser and threshold branch is unit-testable on fixture manifests, which is what makes the foundation doc's ">30% → promote" assertion directly checkable.
- **The denominator is the honest part.** `ratio = repositoriesUsing / repositoriesScanned`, and a repo that could not be read (`manifest_unavailable` from a stub search driver, or no manifest for the ecosystem) is excluded from **both** sides. Counting an unscanned repo as a non-adopter would understate every ratio and suppress legitimate promotions — the quietest possible wrong answer here.
- **Coverage travels with the number.** `RadarAnalysis.coverage` reports scanned/unavailable/failed/total, and the prompt requires the scanned count beside any ratio. "30% of 10 scanned repos" is a very different claim from "30% of 400", and a proposal that hides the sample size is not reviewable.
- Thresholds are a **config-declared table** keyed on `(fromRing, toRing)` with an optional velocity requirement, so an architect can see and tune exactly what triggers a promotion. Demotions (`adopt → hold`) are deliberately **not** automated: falling adoption is weak evidence for deprecation, which is a policy decision rather than a measurement.
- **Declared, not used.** A dependency in `package.json` may be dev-only, vendored, or dead. Metrics say "declared in a manifest" and the prompt forbids "in production use" phrasing. No transitive or lockfile resolution in v1.
- Matching manifest package names to `RadarEntry.id` uses a config alias map (`vite` ↔ `@vitejs/plugin-*`), with unmatched-but-popular packages reported as **radar gaps** — technologies widely used but absent from the radar, which is often the more valuable finding.

## Longitudinal Observation Series (New Structural Section)

Velocity is the foundation doc's key signal, and the core store cannot currently answer "what did this look like 90 days ago".

- **The gap is real**: `ArtifactSink` is write-only and `SqlAgentRuntimeStore` has no artifact query, so a sweep cannot read prior sweeps' artifacts. v1 therefore writes each `AdoptionSnapshot` as an artifact **for the record** and separately maintains a compact rolling series in a plugin-owned checkpoint keyed by a stable `observationSeriesId`.
- The series is deliberately **tiny and aggregate**: `{ takenAt, repositoriesScanned, counts: Record<technology, number> }`. No repository lists, no dependency files, no per-file data — bounded to `maxSeriesEntries` and pruned to `velocityWindowDays`, so it cannot grow without limit inside a checkpoint.
- `velocity.ts` is pure over that series and reports an explicit **`insufficient_history`** direction when fewer than `minSnapshots` exist. A first sweep must never present a fabricated trend — the honest answer is "no history yet", and threshold rules requiring positive velocity simply do not fire.
- Snapshots are only appended for sweeps whose coverage exceeds `minCoverageRatio`, so a partially-failed sweep cannot poison the trend line with an artificially low count.
- The series is keyed by scan **scope** (ecosystems + target set), so narrowing a sweep starts a new series rather than silently comparing incomparable populations.
- **Long-term fix**: adding `listArtifacts(filter)` to `RunStore`/`ArtifactSink` in core would let this read its own history properly and would serve every trend-oriented agent. Listed in Shared Work; the checkpoint approach is a deliberate bridge, not the destination.

## Approval-Gated Radar Submission (New Structural Section)

Two write paths share one gate, and one of them currently lies about success.

- The gate uses existing `ApprovalRequest`/`ApprovalDecision`, `CheckpointStore`, and `AuditLogSink` — no new machinery. The payload carries every proposed transition (technology, from-ring, to-ring, ratio, sample size) and every deprecation ticket, so the reviewer sees exactly what will be written.
- **`proposal_not_durable` is a first-class limitation.** When the active driver is `tech-radar`, `submitRadarProposal` stores into an in-memory `Map` and returns a synthetic ID. The plugin records `durable: false` on that submission, attaches the limitation to the analysis, and the UI must say *queued for review* rather than *submitted to the radar*. Reporting a vanished proposal as applied would quietly erode trust in the whole agent.
- `submit.ts` is ordered and partially-failable: proposals first, then deprecation tickets. There is no batch op for either, so each is a sequential call with per-target success/failure recorded — and no rollback attempted, since neither driver exposes a delete.
- **Idempotency by `(technology, fromRing, toRing, observationSeriesId)`** for proposals and `(technology, owner, ring)` for tickets. A repeated approved resume re-reads the prior `RadarSubmissionRecord` and skips completed targets, so double-clicking approve cannot double-file.
- Both writes use the **approver's** credentials so radar and board permissions apply, and every target's outcome is audited individually alongside the ratio that justified it — the audit trail an Architecture Review Board needs.
- Scheduled sweeps reach the gate but cannot satisfy it: the service principal holds no approval authority, so an unapproved proposal set expires as a pending artifact rather than mutating policy on a cron.

## Background Scheduler Tasks (Weekly Sweep)

- `scheduler/weeklySweep.ts` registers one `coreServices.scheduler` task: `id: 'tech-radar-manager-weekly-sweep'`, `frequency: { cron }` from config (default `0 22 * * 0` — Sunday night, matching the foundation doc), bounded `timeout`, non-zero `initialDelay`, `scope: 'global'`.
- The task POSTs runs to `/agents/tech-radar-ai-manager/runs` via `auth.getPluginRequestToken` + `discovery.getBaseUrl('ai-core')` with `source: 'scheduler'`, `propose: true`. It never executes the graph in-process.
- **Scheduled sweeps stop at the approval gate and never submit autonomously**, so a cron loop cannot drift the radar without an architect's decision.
- The sweep is also the **observation collector**: even an analysis-only run appends its `AdoptionSnapshot`, so trend history accrues whether or not anyone approves a proposal. This is why the sweep should be enabled well before proposals are.
- Guardrails: global mutex, per-sweep repo cap, sequential dispatch with delay, coverage floor before snapshotting, and kill switch `sweep.enabled` (default **false**).

## Vector Store Integration

- **No new vector infrastructure and no new indexing.** `knowledge.retrieve` reads the existing corpus (architecture-decision records, radar rationale docs, migration guides) owned by `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-retrieval-augmenter`; observation/checkpoint state lives in `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-runtime-store`.
- Retrieval is **rationale only** and structurally barred from `measure.ts`/`transitions.ts`, which receive counters, radar entries, and config — never retrieval output. Tests assert ratios and proposed transitions are byte-identical with retrieval on and off.
- **Never index manifests or dependency inventories.** They change constantly and describe internal architecture; embedding them would create a stale, sensitive shadow inventory outside catalog permissions.

## Configuration

```yaml
ai:
  agents:
    techRadarManager:
      model: tech-radar-manager     # installation-registered model ID, required
      radar:

      maxToolInvocations: 220       # optional, default 220 (one+ read per repo)
      sweepTimeoutSeconds: 1800     # optional, default 1800 wall-clock budget
      ecosystems:                   # optional; manifest parsers to run
        npm: ['package.json']
        go: ['go.mod']
        python: ['requirements.txt', 'pyproject.toml']
      aliases:                      # optional package -> radar entry id mapping
        '@vitejs/plugin-react': vite
      thresholds:                   # ring transition rules, evaluated in order
        - from: assess
          to: trial
          minRatio: 0.3             # the foundation doc's 30% case
        - from: trial
          to: adopt
          minRatio: 0.6
          requireRisingVelocity: true
      observations:
        velocityWindowDays: 90      # optional, default 90 (quarterly review)
        minSnapshots: 2             # optional, default 2 before reporting a trend
        maxSeriesEntries: 26        # optional, default 26 (~6 months weekly)

      tickets:
        enabled: false              # optional, default false; gates deprecation tickets
        labels: ['tech-radar', 'deprecation']
      sweep:
        enabled: false              # optional, default false
        cron: '0 22 * * 0'          # optional, default Sunday 22:00
```

`config.ts` mirrors `readCatalogAiInsightsConfig`: throw when the section, `model`, or `radar.sourceUrl` is absent; document every default in `config.d.ts`. Validate at boot that every `thresholds` entry names known rings, that `minRatio` is within `0..1`, and that no rule proposes a demotion (`adopt → hold`) — v1 refuses to automate demotions, so such a rule is a configuration error rather than a silent no-op.

## Shared AI-Core Work To Build First

- **Nothing blocks a useful v1**: radar read, repo enumeration, manifest scan, measurement, proposal drafting, and both approval-gated writes all work with today's contracts.
- **Blocking for real radar integration — persist `TechRadarDriver` proposals.** The driver's `Map` must become durable storage (a table, or a PR against the radar source via the future `vcs.pull_request.create`), and `techRadar.url` must actually be used. Until then the plugin is honest but its submissions do not survive a restart. This lives in `plugin-ai-core-backend-module-quality-scorecards-techradar`, not here.
- **Recommended — `listArtifacts(filter)` on the runtime store.** Would let this plugin read its own history instead of maintaining a checkpoint-backed series, and would serve every trend-oriented agent. Additive to `RunStore`/`ArtifactSink`.
- **Optional — extend VCS search coverage.** Real `searchRepository` for Bitbucket/Gerrit converts `manifest_unavailable` repos into counted ones, directly improving ratio representativeness. Shared with `search-ai-context` and `tech-debt-ai-scout`.
- **Deferred — the events contract** for PR-time duplicate-capability alerts. Shared with `search-ai-context`; do not build a bespoke subscriber here.
- **No new measurement, threshold, or scheduling machinery** — `manifests.ts`, `measure.ts`, `transitions.ts`, `deprecations.ts`, `velocity.ts`, and `sweepPlanner.ts` are plugin-local pure modules; approval types, `resume()`, checkpoints, audit, and the scheduler are consumed as-is.

## Frontend Plan

Mirror the `catalog-ai-insights` frontend layout and wiring exactly: `alpha.ts` composing extensions into a `createFrontendPlugin` `FrontendFeature`, `extensions/api.ts` using `ApiBlueprint.make({ params: defineParams => defineParams(createApiFactory({...})) })`, `extensions/components.ts` using `PageBlueprint.make({ name, params: { path, title, routeRef, loader } })`, self-contained wire types in `@types/`, and an SSE client over `discoveryApi.getBaseUrl('ai-core')` with `eventsource-parser` and `Last-Event-ID` replay. Every directory carries a barrel `index.ts`. The package directory exists but is **empty** — scaffold it from scratch.

Frontend deltas vs `catalog-ai-insights`:

- `backstage.pluginId: 'tech-radar-ai-manager'`; package `@webstackbuilders/plugin-ai-agent-frontend-tech-radar-ai-manager`.
- Primary surface is a **standalone proposal dashboard** via `PageBlueprint`. No `EntityCardBlueprint` — the subject is an organization-wide technology, not one catalog entity.
- **`CoverageBanner` is a correctness surface.** Every ratio must be shown against its sample size and unscanned count; "30% adoption" from 8 of 200 repositories is not a promotion case, and the UI must make that visible rather than letting a percentage stand alone.
- **`SubmissionOutcomePanel` must surface the durability flag.** When `durable: false`, it reads *"queued for review — not persisted to the radar source"*, never a bare success. This is the UI half of the stub-driver finding, and getting it wrong would misinform the review board.
- `AdoptionEvidencePanel` lists the exact repositories counted, deep-linked, so an architect can audit a ratio by clicking rather than trusting it.
- `VelocityChart` renders `insufficient_history` explicitly as an empty-with-explanation state — never a flat line implying measured stability.
- `RadarGapPanel` surfaces widely-used technologies missing from the radar, often the most actionable output of a sweep.
- `radar_unavailable`, `no_targets`, `partial`, and `truncated` (with a continue affordance) render as first-class explained outcomes, not errors.

## Test Strategy

Reuse the `catalog-ai-insights` test-layer table (unit/contract/backend integration/runtime integration/LLM evaluation/full-stack E2E) and its network policies. Deltas only:

- **Unit (the highest-value layer here)**: `radarSource.ts` JSON and YAML parsing, plus a malformed radar producing `radar_unavailable` rather than an empty entry list. `manifests.ts` per-ecosystem parsing (`package.json` deps + devDeps, `go.mod` require blocks, `requirements.txt` pins) and alias mapping. `measure.ts` ratio arithmetic — specifically that a `manifest_unavailable` repo is excluded from **both** numerator and denominator. `transitions.ts` threshold evaluation including the `requireRisingVelocity` guard and refusal to emit demotions. `deprecations.ts` hold-ring matching with owner routing. `velocity.ts` `insufficient_history` on a single snapshot.
- **Workflow (runtime) tests**: drive `RadarGraph.run()` with a stubbed `WorkflowContext` (`invokeTool` mock router keyed by `toolId` + args), a fake `CatalogEntityResolver`, and a fixture radar file — the codebase-accurate replacement for the foundation doc's `github.service` sketch. **Headline scenario (the foundation doc's own test)**: radar has `vite: assess` and `webpack: adopt`; three repos scanned where `repo-alpha` and `repo-beta` declare `vite` and `repo-gamma` declares `webpack`. Assert `vite` measures `2/3 ≈ 0.67`, crosses the 0.3 threshold, produces an `assess → trial` proposal citing both repos, the run **suspends** at `approval_request`, and neither write tool was called.
- **Denominator-integrity test** (the plugin's sharpest correctness risk): the same fixture but with `repo-gamma` on a stub search driver. Assert it is `manifest_unavailable`, the ratio becomes `2/2 = 1.0` over a **scanned count of 2**, coverage reports one unavailable, and a limitation is attached — never `2/3` with a silent miscount.
- **Velocity tests**: seed an `ObservationSeries` with a prior snapshot at 10% and assert `direction: 'rising'` and that a `requireRisingVelocity` rule fires; with no prior snapshot assert `insufficient_history` and that the same rule does **not** fire.
- **Snapshot-hygiene tests**: a sweep below `minCoverageRatio` appends **no** snapshot (so a partial sweep cannot poison the trend); a narrowed scope starts a new `observationSeriesId`; the series prunes to `maxSeriesEntries`.
- **Resumability tests** (the foundation doc's §2): interrupt the scan at repo 50 of 100 and assert the cursor **and accumulated counters** are checkpointed, status is `truncated`, and `resume()` continues at repo 51 without re-reading the radar or re-scanning completed repos.
- **Durability-honesty test**: with the `tech-radar` driver active, `resume('approved')` records `durable: false`, attaches `proposal_not_durable`, and the artifact does **not** claim the radar was updated.
- **Approval-gate hardening**: no write when the model hallucinates a tool call or attempts to skip the gate; `resume('approved')` submits each proposal and files each ticket exactly once; a mid-loop failure yields `partially_submitted` with exact `failures`; a repeated approved resume submits nothing new (idempotent by `(technology, fromRing, toRing, seriesId)`).
- **Anti-fabrication tests**: a model rationale naming a repository, package, ratio, or ring absent from the computed record is stripped; assert the executive summary contains no technology outside `metrics`.
- **`knowledge.retrieve` isolation**: pre-baked ADR chunks; assert ratios, transitions, and deprecations are byte-identical with retrieval on and off.
- **Scheduler tests**: `mockServices.scheduler` fast-forwards the Sunday tick; assert bounded authenticated dispatch, `sweep.enabled: false` respected, mutex skipping, **no autonomous submission**, and that an analysis-only sweep still appends its snapshot.
- **Backend integration**: `startTestBackend` with this module + AI Core + `mockServices.rootConfig` + `mockServices.database` + `mockServices.urlReader` (the foundation doc's `extraReaders` radar fixture), asserting boot registration, per-node SSE ordering, per-repo checkpointing, resume flow, and analysis/submission artifact persistence.
- **E2E**: extend the shared fixture profile with a fixture radar file, fixture repositories with seeded manifests, and fixture radar/ticket drivers. Playwright: open the dashboard → run an analysis → inspect coverage, adoption evidence, and the proposal → approve → assert the outcome panel shows the durability caveat; plus a reject path and an `insufficient_history` first-sweep path. Add `yarn test:e2e:tech-radar-ai-manager`.

## Security and Operational Guardrails

`catalog-ai-insights` guardrails apply unchanged (identity propagation, redaction before model/SSE/artifacts, tool/token/wall-clock caps, correlation IDs). Radar-specific additions:

- **No radar change or ticket without a persisted human approval**, and both write paths default to disabled. The decision, `approvedBy`, every proposal's ratio and sample size, and every returned ID are audit-logged; rejections are audited too. Scheduled sweeps reach the gate but cannot satisfy it.
- **Never overstate a submission.** When the driver is in-memory, `durable: false` and `proposal_not_durable` must appear in the artifact and the UI. Silent data loss presented as success is the failure mode most likely to discredit the plugin with an Architecture Review Board.
- **Never miscount the denominator.** Unscannable repositories are excluded and reported, never treated as non-adopters; every ratio ships with its sample size and coverage.
- **Radar rings come from the radar.** The plugin never infers a current ring, never edits the source file, and refuses to propose demotions automatically — deprecation is a policy judgment, not a measurement.
- Manifests describe internal architecture: cap `maxRepositories` and per-file bytes, retain **aggregate counts** rather than raw manifest bodies in artifacts and observations, and scrub secret-shaped strings from any snippet before it reaches the model, SSE, artifacts, or logs.
- Manifest content is **untrusted input**: delimit it in the prompt with an instruction not to follow embedded directives, since a dependency name or description field is attacker-influenceable in a forked repository.
- Authorization is per-caller: radar, repository, and ticket reads propagate the requester's credentials; writes use the approver's, so radar and board permissions apply.
- Third-party APIs are metered: per-sweep repo caps plus a wall-clock budget mean a fleet sweep degrades to `truncated` rather than exhausting a code-search or Jira quota.

## Ordered Implementation Milestones

### Milestone 0: Pure engines and contracts

- [ ] Confirm `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal` (and its stub driver), `project.ticket.create`, `vcs.repository.search`/`read_file`, and `CatalogEntityResolver` against the installed code; enumerate search-capable providers.
- [ ] Define `RadarEntry`, `DeclaredDependency`, `RepoScanOutcome`, `AdoptionMetric`, `RingTransitionProposal`, `DeprecationFinding`, `AdoptionSnapshot`, `RadarAnalysis`, `RadarSubmissionRecord`, and the config schema.
- [ ] Implement + unit-test `radarSource.ts`, `manifests.ts`, `measure.ts`, `transitions.ts`, `deprecations.ts`, `velocity.ts`, and `sweepPlanner.ts`.

Exit criteria: ratio arithmetic (including denominator exclusion), threshold evaluation, and `insufficient_history` handling are provably deterministic on fixtures.

### Milestone 1: Analysis backend (read-only)

- [ ] Scaffold the package with a barrel `index.ts` in every directory, register the runner/agent/manual trigger, config parsing; register in root `tsconfig.json` + `.eslintrc.cjs`.
- [ ] Implement radar.load → enumerate → scan → measure → propose → `radar-analysis`, with `RepoTargetResolver` and `RadarToolRunner` (including `manifest_unavailable` classification).
- [ ] Wire into `packages/backend` and add the `ai.agents.techRadarManager` config block.
- [ ] Add unit, workflow-scenario, denominator-integrity, and backend integration tests.

Exit criteria: the foundation doc's vite-vs-webpack fixture produces a correct `assess → trial` proposal with cited repositories, no real LLM, and no writes.

### Milestone 2: Observation series and resumable sweeps

- [ ] Implement `ObservationSeries` (checkpoint-backed rolling snapshots, scope keying, pruning, coverage floor), velocity computation, and per-repo cursor/counter checkpointing with per-repo error isolation.
- [ ] Velocity, snapshot-hygiene, and resumability tests.

Exit criteria: velocity is computed from real history with an honest `insufficient_history` first sweep; an interrupted sweep resumes without losing counters.

### Milestone 3: Approval-gated submission

- [ ] Implement the gate + `RadarGraph.resume()`: checkpointed proposal/ticket set, `approval_request`, sequential submission via `quality.scorecard.submit_radar_proposal` and `project.ticket.create`, durability flagging, `radar-submission-record` artifact, audit, and idempotency.
- [ ] Gate-hardening and durability-honesty tests.

Exit criteria: writes occur only after approval, exactly once per target, and a non-durable submission is provably reported as such.

### Milestone 4: Scheduled sweep, frontend, and E2E

- [ ] Implement `weeklySweep` with mutex, caps, coverage floor, and kill switch, plus fast-forwarded scheduler tests asserting no autonomous submission and snapshot accrual on analysis-only runs.
- [ ] Scaffold the empty frontend package (`ApiBlueprint` + `PageBlueprint`, dashboard, analysis dialog, run view, proposal table, adoption evidence, coverage banner, velocity chart, deprecation list, radar gaps, quarterly summary, approval bar, outcome panel) with barrel indexes, and register it in `packages/app`.
- [ ] Component tests (loading, streaming, radar_unavailable/no_targets/partial/truncated, insufficient history, awaiting approval, submitted, partially_submitted, replay) plus accessibility checks — including assertions that coverage accompanies every ratio and that `durable: false` is visibly distinct from success.
- [ ] Extend the E2E fixture profile and add Playwright analysis, approve, reject, and first-sweep scenarios with screenshot review.

Exit criteria: `yarn test:e2e:tech-radar-ai-manager` demonstrates analysis → proposal → approve → outcome with the durability caveat, plus reject and no-history paths, without external infrastructure.

### Milestone 5: Production readiness

- [ ] Document model registration, radar source setup, threshold tuning, alias curation, ecosystem parsers, sweep/write enablement, approver permissions, and — prominently — the **in-memory radar driver caveat** and the declared-vs-used measurement boundary.
- [ ] Dashboards/alerts for proposals per sweep, **coverage ratio** (the key trust metric), `manifest_unavailable` count, approval/rejection ratio, non-durable submission count, radar-gap count, and token cost per sweep.
- [ ] Opt-in real-model evaluation suite (grounding: every rationale cites counted repositories; no invented packages, ratios, or rings; no "in production use" phrasing) within budget.
- [ ] Follow-ups: persist `TechRadarDriver` proposals, add `listArtifacts` to core, extend Bitbucket/Gerrit search.

Exit criteria: staged rollout with sweeps enabled but writes disabled, verified measurement grounding, and the durability caveat documented for the review board.

## Definition of Done

- Package, agent, runner (`run` + `resume`), triggers (manual + sweep), config schema, and the allow-list implemented and registered (root + backend/app wiring included), with a barrel `index.ts` in every directory.
- Runs execute through the real AI Core controller/runtime with persisted replayable events, per-repository checkpoints preserving counters, and `radar-analysis` / `radar-submission-record` artifacts.
- Adoption ratios, ring transitions, and deprecation findings are pure, config-driven, deterministic code — never model output — and every ratio ships with its sample size and coverage.
- Unscannable repositories are excluded from both numerator and denominator and reported as `manifest_unavailable`; no repository is ever silently counted as a non-adopter.
- Velocity comes from a real observation series with an explicit `insufficient_history` state; partial sweeps never append a snapshot.
- No radar proposal or ticket is written without a persisted approval; submissions are idempotent, use the approver's credentials, and a non-durable submission is reported as `durable: false` with a `proposal_not_durable` limitation rather than as success.
- The plugin never edits the radar source file, never infers a current ring, and never automates a demotion.
- Frontend renders proposals, coverage, adoption evidence, velocity, and approval over live SSE and replay via `ApiBlueprint`/`PageBlueprint`; Playwright verifies analysis, approve, reject, and first-sweep paths on fixtures.
- No output surface (SSE, artifacts, logs, audit, tests, tickets) contains raw manifest bodies, secrets, uncited ratios, invented packages or rings, or a submission presented as durable when it is not.
