 * Compile-time guard that fails `yarn typecheck` when the runtime-facing

 * drift apart.
 *
 * The two declarations intentionally duplicate the same shape: `config.d.ts`
 * must stay self-contained for published config-schema loading, while `src`
 * code must not reference it so the emitted `dist-types` tree remains
 * resolvable by the declaration bundler. This file is excluded from vitest
 * (`.test-d.ts` does not match its `*.test.ts` include patterns) and exists
 * solely for `tsc --noEmit`.
